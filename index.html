    <p>Ok now let me get something straight It is a short story by the way. And we live in a cave near a jungle! We also live near a waterfall!! But it is not as easy to get food/ cook it! We collect stones and wood to make a fire to cook as well we have to do the hunting to get the food! We also make wood weapons to help us hunt! And we use stones to carve the wood to make weapons to hunt! After I get out of my bed I see it is still dark out side then a big monster came out! My name is lea and I got so scared I ran around the jungle make the monster stop casing  and I ran back in the cave and I put a big bag of rice monsters are allergic to rice and slept nice good! And in the morning I got to hunt it was cool we had fish and seaweed and deer and wolf after I was done I went out side to see the stars! I slept well good night!</p>

    <p>After a few mins I woke up and in the cave there was some food I ate one fish yum! </p>

    <p>I went back to bed and when it was morning I saw a small monster it was very small it so small It was the size of your pinky finger! After a few mins it the yelled as it was in danger but she was wasn’t in danger she was scared I was sad It was very hurt it looked like they got in to a fight! I ran to take care of it bit it was not easy to train a wild baby dragon I also made a cast out of webs and plants I chose to adopt it! I got a free friend I put lily the baby dragon and I went to sleep I live with one boy he is the same age he put me to bed I slept his name is don he slept! And wen we got older we had a baby we named it pam she so nice and smart! </p>

    <p>The end!</p>
